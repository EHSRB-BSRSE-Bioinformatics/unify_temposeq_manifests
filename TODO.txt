probe name
gene ensembl id
gene symbol
ligated sequence
aligned transcript ids

things to check

lines without ensembl gene IDs
do the lines without ensembl IDs have gene IDs?
do the ensembl and entrez IDs match?
same gene symbol (id?), different coordinates
do the ligated coordinates match the coordinates of the gene?
